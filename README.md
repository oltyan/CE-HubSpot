# CE-HubSpot
As simple a web framework as possible to display data.

# Using the app
I didn't make a dependency file for this, but it's pretty straight forward. Make sure you have python3 or > install, and:
* pip install flask
* pip install whatever auth library Im going to use
* pip install other modules that I'll leverage


* Nothing will be encrypted, and all accounts will be test data
* Very basic views will be used with minimal formatted, just from a time perspective
